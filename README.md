# Java-Spring-Boot-Topic-Course-API

This is a sample project in which I developed RESTful API's using Java Spring Boot Framework.

The "Course Management System" API contains the topics and courses related to the topics. I had made a bunch of RESTful API's endpoints to view all/by id ,add, update and delete the topics and courses respectively. 

Also used Spring Boot's 'Actuator' dependency to monitor and manage the Spring web application.
